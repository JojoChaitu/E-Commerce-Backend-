## To Run

- npm install and node app.js

## Notes

- I used mongoDb Atlas which is the cloud one.
- I saved my mongoDb database connection Uri in a .env file, so you have to create your own .env file and save your connection string over there.

## Routes

- The main route is  " /api/v1/signup/ " to hit signup page and create a user.
